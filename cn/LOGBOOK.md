## Logbook {#logbook}

_Little Navmap_ creates logbook entries for each flight automatically when detecting a takeoff or landing. A logbook entry containing only departure is created on takeoff and finalized with destination and more information on landing.

Check [Create Logbook entries](MENUS.md#logbook-create-entries) to enable this functionality which is default.

Note that all times, fuel consumption and other values are measured between takeoff and landing since it is not reliably possible to detect the start and end of a flight.

Use [Reset all Settings and Restart](#reset-and-restart) to be sure that the logbook flight detection is set up for a new flight.

Editing functionality in the logbook is similar to the userpoints editing ([User-defined Waypoints](USERPOINT.md#userpoints)).

## Logbook Search {#search}

The functionality of the search filters and the result table is equal to the airport and navaid search. See [Search Dock Window](SEARCH.md) for information about search filters and buttons.

Additional context menu items and buttons allow adding, editing, and deleting of logbook entries.

One or more logbook entries are highlighted on the map with blue lines connecting departure and destination as well as the two airports once selected in the search result table.

The label at the connecting great circle line shows departure airport ident, destination airport ident and great circle distance. A tooltip is shown if hovering the mouse over the blue line.

_**Picture above:** Map showing several logbook entries selected and highlighted. Departure and destination of each entry is connected by a great circle line. A tooltip shows more information._

### Top Buttons and additional Menu Items {#logbook-top-buttons}

See [Search Result Table View Context Menu](SEARCH.md#search-result-table-view-context-menu) for a description of common context menu items across all search dialogs. All buttons have an equivalent in the result table context menu.

#### ![Add Logbook Entry](../images/icons/logdata_add.png "Add Logbook Entry") Add Logbook Entry {#logbook-add}

Add a logbook entry manually.

See `Add Logbook Entry Dialog` below for more information about the add/edit dialog.

#### ![Edit Logbook Entry](../images/icons/logdata_edit.png "Edit Logbook Entry") Edit Logbook Entry {#logbook entries-edit}

Open the edit dialog for one or more logbook entries.

The edit dialog shows a column of checkboxes on the right side if more than one logbook entry is selected. These allow to choose the fields to change for all selected entries.

See `Edit Logbook Entry Dialog` below for more information about the add/edit dialog.

#### ![Delete Logbook Entry](../images/icons/logdata_delete.png "Delete Logbook Entry") Delete Logbook Entry {#logbook entries-delete}

Remove the selected logbook entries after a confirmation dialog. Undo is not possible but database backups are created on each start. See [Logbook](FILES.md#logbook) for information about database backup files.

#### ![Open Flight Plan](../images/icons/fileopen.png "Open Flight Plan") Open Flight Plan {#open-flight-plan}

Opens the referenced flight plan file. This menu item is disabled if the flight plan field in the logbook entry is empty or if the flight plan file is not accessible.

#### ![Open Aircraft Performance](../images/icons/aircraftperfload.png "Open Aircraft Performance") Open Aircraft Performance {#aircraft-menu-load}

Loads a `lnmperf` aircraft performance profile and shows the fuel report. This menu item is disabled if the aircraft performance field in the logbook entry is empty or if the file is not accessible.

#### ![Reset Search](../images/icons/clear.png "Reset Search") Reset Search {#logbook entries-reset-search}

Clear search filters and revert to showing all entries in the search result table view.

#### ![Clear Selection](../images/icons/clearselection.png "Clear Selection") Clear Selection {#logbook entries-clear-selection}

#### ![Menu Button](../images/icons/menubutton.png "Menu Button") Menu Button {#logbook entries-menu}

Drop down menu button that allows to hide or show search options.

The drop down menu prefixes menu items with a change indicator `*` to show that the related filter row has modifications.

### Add Logbook Entry Dialog {#logbook-dialog-add}

Allows to create a new log entry manually. The dialog layout and functionality is the same as for editing logbook entries. The button `Reset` clears all fields.

### Edit Logbook Entry Dialog {#logbook-dialog-edit}

The dialogs for editing and adding are equal and contain three tabs.

Most fields have a tooltip explaining the meaning, are optional and can be freely edited.

The button `Reset` undoes all manual changes and reverts all fields back to the original state.

#### Page Logbook Entry

Additional notes about some fields on this page:

* **Departure** and **Destination**: These are automatically resolved to an airport. Coordinates (not shown and not editable) are assigned to the departure or destination airport if found. The dialog will show the airport name and elevation if the airport ident can be resolved. Otherwise an error message is shown.
* **Date and Time in Simulator UTC**: Time set in the simulator on liftoff or touchdown. Always UTC.
* **Real local Time**: Real world time on liftoff or touchdown. Stored in your local time.
* **Route Description**: [Flight Plan Route Description](ROUTEDESCR.md) extracted from the flight plan.
* **Flight plan file** and **Aircraft performance file**: Used flight plan and performance files. These are only references which will turn invalid if the files are moved or renamed.

#### Page Fuel and Weight

Block fuel and trip fuel are extracted from the [Tab Fuel Report](AIRCRAFTPERF.md#fuel-report).

Used fuel is the fuel consumption between liftoff and touchdown.

#### Page Description or Comments

Links are recognized in the field `Description` and can be opened in the dock window `Information` on tab `Navaids` which is shown after clicking on a logbook entry or selecting `Show Information` in one of the context menus.

Normal web links like `http://www.example.com` or `https://www.example.com` are recognized besides directory or file links like `file:///C:/Users/me/Documents/Aircraft%20Notes.txt` on Windows or `file:///home/me/Aircraft%20Notes.txt` on macOS or Linux.

Note that you have to use the forward slash `/` instead of the backslash `\` on Windows as a path separator.

Replace spaces in links with `%20` since _Little Navmap_ recognizes links until the next space.

#### Edit a single Logbook Entry

![Logbook Edit](../images/logbook_edit.jpg "Logbook Edit")

_**Picture above:** Editing a logbook entry._

#### Edit multiple Logbook Entries

If more than one logbook entry was selected for editing, the edit dialog shows a column of checkboxes on the right side of available fields. Not all fields are available for bulk edit.

If checked, the field to the left is unlocked and any text entered will be assigned to the respective field in all selected logbook entry. Unchecked fields will not be altered for any of the selected entries.

In combination with the search function, this allows for bulk changes like fixing an invalid aircraft type.

![Logbook Bulk Edit](../images/logbook_bulk_edit.jpg "Logbook Bulk Edit")

_**Picture above:** Editing more than on logbook entry. Three fields are to be changed for the selected entries._

### Logbook Statistics Dialog {#statistics}

This dialog shows two tabs:

1. `Overview` contains a general report which can be copied as formatted text to the clipboard.
2. `Grouped Queries` has a button on top which shows different reports in the table below. The content of the table can be copied as CSV to the clipboard.

![Logbook Statistics](../images/logbook_stats.jpg "Logbook Statistics")

_**Picture above:** Overview tab of logbook statistics dialog._

### Import and Export {#import-export}

The full logbook can be imported and exported to a CSV (comma separated value) text file which can be loaded in _LibreOffice Calc_ or _Microsoft Excel_. All data can be exported and imported which allows to use this function for backup purposes.

Note that it is not possible to export a selection similar to the userpoints. Only the full logbook can be exported. Import appends the logbook entries from the CSV file to already present logbook entries.

Export and import can be done by using the menu items [Import CSV](MENUS.md#logbook-import-csv) and  [Export CSV](MENUS.md#logbook-export-csv).

See chapter `CSV Data Format` below for more information on the format.

### X-Plane Import {#import-xplane}

Import the X-Plane logbook file `.../X-Plane 11/Output/logbooks/X-Plane Pilot.txt` into the _Little Navmap_ logbook database. Note that the X-Plane logbook format is limited and does not provide enough information to fill all _Little Navmap_ logbook fields.

The imported logbook entries get a description containing `Imported from X-Plane logbook X-Plane Pilot.txt` which allows to search for the imported entries. Use a pattern like `*Imported from X-Plane logbook X-Plane Pilot.txt*` in the description search field to look for all imported entries.

**Available information in the X-Plane logbook:**

1. Date of flight
1. Departure airport
1. Destination airport
1. Number of landings - added to description.
1. Duration of flight
1. Time spent flying cross-country, in IFR conditions and at night - added to description.
1. Aircraft tail number
1. Aircraft type

**X-Plane logbook example:**

### Conversion {#convert}

Automatically converts all legacy log entries that were collected as userpoints having type `Logbook`. The conversion copies them to the new logbook after showing an information dialog.

The conversion works best if field `Description` in the userpoints was not modified and if no entries were inserted manually.

The converted logbook entries are appended to the current logbook. The original userpoint of type `Logbook` are not deleted or modified.

The converted logbook entries get a description containing `Converted from userdata` which allows to search for the imported entries. Use a pattern like `*Converted from userdata*` in the description search field to search for all entries.

Not all values can be recovered but the original description from the userpoint is stored in the description of the new logbook entry.

A warning dialog is displayed after the conversion which shows any issues during conversion.

![Logbook Conversion Warnings](../images/logbook_conversion.jpg "Logbook Conversion Warnings")

_**Picture above:** Logbook conversion warnings shown after converting userpoints._

### Database Backup Files {#logbook-data-format}

_Little Navmap_ creates a full database backup on every start since undo functionality is not available for logbook entries.

You can also use the CSV export to create backups manually since CSV allows to export the full dataset.

See [Logbook](FILES.md#logbook) for information about database backup files.


### CSV Data Format {#logbook-csv}

English number format (dot `.` as decimal separator) is used in import and export to allow exchange of files on computers with different language and locale settings.

_Little Navmap_ uses [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 ) encoding when reading and writing files. This is only relevant if you use special characters like umlauts, accents or others. Otherwise encoding does not matter.

If an application fails to load a CSV file exported by _Little Navmap_, use [_LibreOffice Calc_](https://www.libreoffice.org), _Microsoft Excel_ or any other spreadsheet software capable of reading and writing CSV files to adapt the exported file to the format expected by that application.

See [Comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) in the Wikipedia for detailed information on the format.

Altitudes are always feet and distances are always nautical miles in the exported CSV.

The first line of the CSV contains the field names.

| Field name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| aircraft_name | Fee name like `Cessna 172` |
| aircraft_type | ICAO type descriptor like `B732` |
