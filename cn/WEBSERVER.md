## Web Server {#webserver}

_Little Navmap_ includes an internal web server showing the map, aircraft progress and airport information with optional automatic refresh in a web browser. The page can be accessed from any computer, tablet or smartphone in the local network.

Note that the functionality is limited. You cannot change map display settings or calculate a flight plan, for example.

The web server is not running per default. You can start it in the `Tools` menu ([Run Webserver](MENUS.md#run-webserver) and then open its page by selecting [Tools - Open Webserver Page in Browser](MENUS.md#open-webserver).

Port and other settings can be changed in [Options - Web Server](OPTIONS.md#web-server).

You need to adjust you router settings to access it from the internet outside your local network. Check out your router manual how to do this. In general you have to change the firewall settings to forward the port 8965 from the router to the computer running _Little Navmap_. **Do not open the firewall completely.**
