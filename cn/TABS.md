## Tabs

The dock windows `Flight Planning`, `Information`, `Simulator Aircraft` and `Search` have tab bars that allow to close, open and move tabs.

Tooltips give more information about the function of a tab.

Note that you cannot move a tab to another window.

### Menu

The context menu above the tab bar (right click on one of the tabs) and the tab button ![Tab Button](../images/tabbutton.jpg "Tab Menus") have the following menu items:

* `Open All`: Opens all tabs. All closed tabs are opened again and added to the right side of the tab bar.
* `Close all Except Current`: All tabs are closed except the currently active.
* `Reset Tab Layout`: Opens all closed tabs again and restores the default order.
* `Lock Tab Layout`: Hides the close buttons to avoid accidental closing. Moving by click and drag as well as closing by double click are disabled. A locked tab bar also occupies less space. You can still close and open tabs using the context menu or menu button.
* `Close Tab`: Only visible in the context menu. Closes the tab below the click spot.
* One menu item for each tab: Toggles tab visibility. A tab is always opened to the right of the current one.

### Mouse actions

* Click and drag a tab to move it.
* Double click a tab to close it.
* Right click a tab to open the context menu.
* Use the mouse wheel above a tab bar to cycle between tabs.

### Stacked Dock Window Tabs

Tabs at the bottom of a window appear when you drop dock windows on each other. Grab a window title bar to move a window out of the stacked display. You can also change the order of these tabs by dragging them around.

See [Dock Windows](DOCKWINDOWS.md) for more information about stacked dock windows.
