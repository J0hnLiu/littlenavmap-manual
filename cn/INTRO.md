## 首次启动 {#first-start}

_Little Navmap_ 在首次启动时复制和处理导航地图数据。 查看 [导航](MENUS.md/#navigraph) 以获取更多关于集成的信息。

准备完成后，[地景库对话框](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog) 将会显示。您可以选择所有可识别的飞行模拟器地景并将它们载入到_Little Navmap_的内部数据库。

**注意X-Plane不能自动识别。在您可以载入货从目录里选择前，您必须手动在`地景库对话框`里设置它的路径。

每个模拟器都有一个单独的数据库，可以在飞行过程中在[地景库目录](MENUS.md#scenery-library-menu)里更改。

A warning dialog will be shown on Windows when starting _Little Navmap_ the first time on a system without FSX or P3D flight simulator installations. See chapter [Running without Flight Simulator Installation](RUNNOSIM.md#running-without-flight-simulator-installation) for more information on this.

You can also go directly to the [Scenery Library Dialog](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog) from there if you have X-Plane installed.

One or more scenery library databases may need to be updated when you install a new version of _Little Navmap_. A question dialog will pop up prompting you to erase the now incompatible database. You can reload the scenery in the [Scenery Library Dialog](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog) after erasing the databases.

## Recommended things to do after Installing {#things-to-do-after-installing}

* The elevation data which is used by default is limited and has a lot of problems. Therefore, I recommend to download and use the offline GLOBE elevation data. See [Options Dialog / Flight Plan Elevation Profile](OPTIONS.md#cache-elevation) for more information.
* Have a look at the [tutorials](TUTORIALS.md) if you use the program the first time.
* See [Install Navigraph Updates](https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap_navigraph.html) on my home page for information how to update _Little Navmap_'s navigation data.
* See [Connecting to a Flight Simulator](CONNECT.md) for the next step to use *Little Navmap* as a moving map. The included *Little Xpconnect* plugin has to be installed for X-Plane.

## How to run a network Setup {#network-setup}

See the two chapters below if you like to run _Little Navmap_ in a networked setup using one computer for the flight simulator and one computer to run _Little Navmap_.

* [Connecting to a Flight Simulator](CONNECT.md)
* [Running without Flight Simulator Installation](RUNNOSIM.md)

**How to prepare a network setup:**

1. Install/extract the whole *Little Navmap* archive on the flying **and** network computer.
1. Copy *Little Xpconnect* to the X-Plane plugins folder if you use X-Plane.
2. Use *Little Navmap* to generate the scenery database on the flying computer. Main menu -&gt; `Scenery Library` -&gt; `Load Scenery Library ...`
3. Copy the database files to the network computer. Quit *Little Navmap* before copying.

**Flying in a network setup:**

1. Start the simulator
2. Start *Little Navconnect* on the flying computer.
3. Run *Little Navmap* on the network computer.
4. Connect *Little Navmap* on the network computer to *Little Navconnect* on the flying computer. Main menu -&gt; `Tools` -&gt; `Flight Simulator Connection ...`

See links above for detailed instructions.

## General {#general-remarks}

### User Interface {#user-interface}

#### Dock Windows

The user interface of _Little Navmap_ consists of a main window and several dock windows which can be detached from the main window or arranged in any order within the main window.

The docked windows can be moved around in their docked position and can be detached from the main window by simply dragging them outside of the main window, by double-clicking their title bar or by clicking on the window symbol on the top right.

Double click on the docked window's title bar or click on the window symbol again to move the windows back into their docked position.

All docked windows except the map window can be closed if they are not needed. You can even drop docked windows on each other to create a tabbed view. The tabs will appear at the bottom of the dock stack in this case.

**Hold **`Ctrl`** while clicking on the window titlebar to prevent a window from going into docked state and keep it floating.**

Toolbars are also movable by clicking on the left handle and can also be closed or detached from the main window.

**Use the **`Main Menu` -&gt; `Window` **menu to restore closed windows or toolbars.**

**The **`Main Menu` -&gt; `Window` -&gt; `Reset Window Layout`** menu item can be used to reset the state and positions of all dock windows and toolbars back to their default.**

#### Context Menus

**Use the context menus to build a flight plan.**

Context menus can be found in the following places:

* Map display window - [Map Context Menu](MAPDISPLAY.md#map-context-menu)
* Flight plan table - [Flight Plan Table View Context Menu](FLIGHTPLAN.md#flight-plan-table-view-context-menu)
* Airport and navaid search result tables - [Search Result Table View Context Menu](SEARCH.md#search-result-table-view-context-menu)
* Procedure search tree - [Procedure Tree Context Menu](SEARCHPROCS.md#procedure-context-menu)

The context menus provide functionality to get more information about an object at the clicked position or to build or edit a flight plan.

#### Tooltip Help, Help Buttons and Help Menu {#help}

The help menu of *Little Navmap* contains links to the online help, an included offline help PDF document, online tutorials and the map legend.

The program uses tooltips to display more information on buttons and other controls.

A more detailed description is shown on the left side of the statusbar if you hover the mouse over a menu item.

Most dialogs and some dock windows show help buttons ![Help](../images/icons/help.png "Help") which will open the corresponding sections of the online manual.

#### Window Title

The main window title indicates the currently selected simulator database \(`FSX`, `FSXSE`, `P3DV2`, `P3DV3`, `P3DV4` or `XP11`\), the flight plan file name and a trailing `*` if the flight plan has been changed.

A `N` will be appended if the Navigraph database is used:

* `P3DV4`: All feartures on the map and all information in dialogs and windows comes from the flight simulator database.
* `P3DV4 / N`: Airports and ILS are shown and used from the flight simulator database. Navaids, airspace, airways and procedures are used from the Navigraph database.
* `(P3DV4) / N`: All data is used from the Navigraph database. No aprons, no taxiways and no parking positions are available for airports.

#### Information and Simulator Aircraft Text

You can change the text size permanently in the options dialog for these windows.

A quick way to change the text size is to use the mousewheel and `Ctrl` key. This setting won't be saved across sessions, though.

#### Tabs

Tabs that appear on top of a window are fixed. A tooltip gives more information about the function of a tab.

Tabs at the bottom of a window appear when you drop dock windows on each other. Grab a window title bar to move a window out of the stacked display. You can change the order of these tabs by dragging them around.

The mousewheel allows to cycle between tabs in a more convenient way.

#### Copy and Paste

Almost all dialogs, text labels and all information windows in _Little Navmap_ allow copy and paste.

You can select the text using the mouse and then either use `Ctrl+C` or the context menu to copy it to the clipboard. The information and simulator aircraft windows even support copying of formatted text including the icons. This can be helpful to report errors.

The table views for the flight plan or airport/navaid search results allow copying of the results in CSV format to the clipboard which can be pasted into a spreadsheet program like [_LibreOffice Calc_](https://www.libreoffice.org) or _Microsoft Excel_.

### Translation and Locale {#translation-and-locale}

_Little Navmap_ is currently available in several languages. 

I will happily support anybody who would like to translate the user interface or manual into another language. Language packages can be added to a _Little Navmap_ installation later once they are available. See [Translating](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/wiki/Translating) in the Github _Little Navmap_ wiki for more information.

You can override the user interface language in the dialog `Options` the the tab `User Interface`.

Despite using the English language in the user interface the locale settings of the operating system will be used. So, e.g. on a German version of Windows you will see comma as a decimal separator instead of the English dot.

The language and locale settings can be forced to English in the dialog `Options` on the tab `User Interface` if a translated user interface is not desired.

Please note that some screenshots in this manual were taken using German locale, therefore a comma is used as a decimal separator and a dot as a thousands separator.

### Map Legend {#map-legend}

The legend explains all the map icons and the `Flight Plan Elevation Profile` icons. It is available in the `Legend` dock window or in this manual: [Legend](LEGEND.md).

### Naming Conventions used in this Manual {#naming-conventions-used-in-this-manual}

`Highlighted text` is used to denote window, menu, button, file or directory names.
See the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for explanations of common terms in this manual.

### Rating {#rating}

Airports get a zero to five star rating depending on facilities. Airports that have no rating are considered boring and will be displayed using a gray symbol below all other airports on the map \(`Empty Airport`\). This behavior can be switched off in the `Options` dialog on the `Map Display` tab.

The criteria below are used to calculate the rating. Each item gives one star:

  1. Add-on \(or 3D for X-Plane\)
  2. Parking positions \(ramp or gate\)
  3. Taxiways
  4. Aprons
  5. Tower building \(only if at least one of the other conditions is met\).

All airports that are not located in the default `Scenery` directory of FSX/P3D or are located in the `Custom Scenery` directory of X-Plane are considered add-on airports which raises the rating by one star.

Airports in the `Custom Scenery/Global Airports/Earth nav data/apt.dat` file of X-Plane are 3D airports which raises the rating by one star too.

### Navdata Updates {#navdata-updates}

_Little Navmap_ comes with a ready to use database from Navigraph including airspaces, SIDs, STARs and more. The database can be updated by using Navigraph's _FMS Data Manager_.

See the chapter [Navigation Databases](NAVDATA.md) for more information.

#### FSX and Prepar3D

*Little Navmap* is compatible with navdata updates from [_fsAerodata_](https://www.fsaerodata.com) or [_FSX/P3D Navaids update_](http://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html).

#### X-Plane

*Little Navmap* will use any navdata updates that are installed in the directory `Custom Data`. Any older updates installed in the GPS directories are not used.

User-defined data from the files `user_fix.dat` and `user_nav.dat` is read and merged into the database if found.

Note that neither ARINC nor the FAACIFP files are supported.

### Magnetic Declination {#magnetic-declination}

The calibrated magnetic declination of a VOR may differ from the actual declination in a region as it does in reality. Therefore, magnetic course values might differ in some cases.

#### FSX and Prepar3D

The declination used to calculate the magnetic course is taken from the `magdec.bgl` file in the scenery database.

Updates for this file are available here: [_FSX/P3D Navaids update_](http://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html).

#### X-Plane

The declination values for X-Plane \(airports and all navaids except VORs\) is calculated based on the included `magdec.bgl` file which is based on the values for the beginning of 2017.
