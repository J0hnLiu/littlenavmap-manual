## 菜单及工具栏 {#menus-and-toolbars}

本章介绍_Little Navmap_的所有菜单项。您也可以在工具栏上找到这些功能的大部分，这些功能并不是单独描述的。在菜单项上可以看到本手册中没有列出快捷键。

![Little Navmap Menu and Toolbars](../images/menutoolbar.jpg "Little Navmap Menu and Toolbars")

_**Picture above:** Menu and toolbars docked in default positions._

### File Menu {#file-menu}

#### ![New Flight Plan](../images/icons/filenew.png "New Flight Plan") New Flight Plan {#new-flight-plan}

Erases the current flight plan.

You have to use the [Search Result Table View Context Menu](SEARCH.md#search-result-table-view-context-menu),  the [Map Context Menu](MAPDISPLAY.md#map-context-menu) or the [Flight Plan Route Description](ROUTEDESCR.md) dialog to create a flight plan.

#### ![Open Flight Plan](../images/icons/fileopen.png "Open Flight Plan") Open Flight Plan {#open-flight-plan}

Opens an FSX PLN, an FS9 PLN, an FSC PLN, an X-Plane FMS or an FLP flight plan file. The type of file is determined by content and not file extension. See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more information.

An opened flight plan file will be reloaded on start up \(reload and centering can be switched off in the `Options` dialog on the `Startup` and `User Interface` tab\).

Procedure information and ground speed will be added to the flight plan if a PLN file is saved by _Little Navmap_. The additional information will be ignored by FSX or P3D but allows to reload all information by _Little Navmap_.

#### ![Append flight plan](../images/icons/fileappend.png "Append flight plan") Append Flight Plan {#append-flight-plan}

Adds departure, destination and all waypoints to the current flight plan.

Using `Append Flight Plan` allows to load or merge complete flight plans or flight plan snippets into a new plan. All waypoints are added at the end of the current flight plan. Then you can use the `Delete selected Legs` and `Move selected Legs up/down` context menu items to arrange the waypoints and airports as required. See [Flight Plan Table View Context Menu](FLIGHTPLAN.md#flight-plan-table-view-context-menu).

All arrival procedures will be removed when appending a flight plan.

#### ![Save Flight Plan](../images/icons/filesave.png "Save Flight Plan") Save Flight Plan {#save-flight-plan}

#### ![Save Flight Plan as PLN](../images/icons/filesaveas.png "Save Flight Plan as PLN") Save Flight Plan as PLN {#save-flight-plan-as}

Saves the flight plan to an FSX/P3D PLN file \(XML format\). This annotated format allows to save all flight plan attributes of *Little Navmap*.

`Save Flight Plan as PLN` changes the current file type and name in *Little Navmap* which means that all further saves will go into the new PLN file.

It is recommended to save all flight plans in this format to keep all information of a plan. Even when using the limited FMS format for X-Plane. See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more information.

_Little Navmap_ will allow flight plans to be created that may be useful as a flight plan snippet but are unusable by the flight simulator. This occurs if a flight plan does not have a departure or destination airport. A warning dialog will be shown when saving a incomplete flight plan.

A warning dialog will also be shown if the departure airport has parking positions but none is assigned in the flight plan.

Procedures will be saved as an annotation in the flight plan file if the flight plan contains any. This causes no problem for the simulators and most other programs. Use [Export clean Flight Plan](MENUS.md#export-clean-flight-plan) if a program has problems reading the PLN files saved by _Little Navmap_.

Note that the waypoints of a procedure are not saved with the flight plan. This is not supported by FSX or P3D. Use the GPS, FMC or other ways to select a procedure in your aircraft.

The set ground speed is also saved with the flight plan.

**Note that P3D v4.2 overwrites the flight plan when loading, which erases all annotations. Save a copy of the plan to another location if you like to keep all information about procedures or speed.**

#### ![Save Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 11](../images/icons/saveasfms.png "Save Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 11") Save Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 11 {#save-flight-plan-as-fms11}

Saves the flight plan using the new X-Plane FMS 11 format. **This format can only be used in X-Plane 11.10 and above. Do not try to load it into the FMS or GPS of X-Plane 11.05. It might crash the simulator.**

A warning dialog will be shown with the warning above when saving.

See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more information on limitations.

This function changes the current file type and name which means that all further saves will go into the new FMS file and the file will be reloaded on next start.

Store FMS files into the `Output/FMS plans` directory inside the X-Plane directory if you would like to use the flight plan in the X-Plane GPS, the G1000 or the FMS.

#### ![Save Flight Plan FLP](../images/icons/saveasflp.png "Save Flight Plan FLP") Save Flight Plan as FLP {#save-flight-plan-as-flp}

Exports the current flight plan as an FLP file usable by the X-Plane FMS, Aerosoft Airbus and other add-on aircraft. This format is limited so a dialog is shown if any unsupported features are detected in the current flight plan.

See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more information on limitations.

This function changes the current file type and name which means that all further saves will go into the new FLP file and the file will be reloaded on next start.

Store FLP files into the `Output/FMS plans` directory inside the X-Plane directory if you want to load it into the FMS.

#### ![Export as Clean PLN](../images/icons/filesaveclean.png "Export as Clean PLN") Export as Clean PLN {#export-clean-flight-plan}

Saves a flight plan without any procedure or speed annotations if programs have problems reading the PLN files saved by _Little Navmap_. This is rarely needed.

Like any other export function this does not change the current file name and type. Further saves will still use the same file name and format as before.

See also [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md).

#### ![Export Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 3](../images/icons/saveasfms.png "Export Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 3") Export Flight Plan as X-Plane FMS 3 {#export-flight-plan-as-fms3}

Saves the flight plan using the older X-Plane FMS 3 format which is limited but can be loaded by X-Plane 10 and X-Plane 11.05. A warning dialog is shown if any unsupported features are detected in the current flight plan.

See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more information on limitations.

This export function this does not change the current file name and type. Further saves will still use the same file name and format as before.

Store FMS files into the `Output/FMS plans` directory inside the X-Plane directory if you would like to use the flight plan in the X-Plane GPS or FMS.

#### Export Flight Plan to other Formats (Sub-Menu) {#export-submenu}

See [Flight Plan Formats](FLIGHTPLANFMT.md) for more detailed information on the available export formats.

Export functions do not change the current file name and type. Further saves will still use the same file name and format as before.

##### Export Flight Plan to corte.in for Flight Factor Airbus {#export-flight-plan-as-fpl}

Appends the the flight plan to a new or already present `corte.in` company routes file for the Flight Factor Airbus aircraft.

The file will be automatically created if it does not exist. Otherwise the flight plan will be appended to the file. You have to remove the flight plan manually from the `corte.in` file with a simple text editor if you wish to get rid of it.

Location of the file depends on aircraft type.

##### Export Flight Plan as FLTPLAN for iFly {#export-flight-plan-as-ifly}

Save flight plan as FLTPLAN file for the iFly 737NG. The format does not allow saving of procedures.

The file should be saved to Path to `XPLANE\Resources\plugins\XFMC\FlightPlans`.

##### Export Flight Plan as GPX {#export-flight-plan-as-gpx}

Exports the current flight plan into a GPS Exchange Format file which can be read by Google Earth and most other GIS applications.

The flight plan is exported as a route and the flown aircraft trail as a track including simulator time and altitude.

The route has departure and destination elevation and cruise altitude set for all waypoints. Waypoints of all procedures are included in the exported file. Note that the waypoints will not allow to reproduce all parts of a procedure like holds or procedure turns.

**Do not forget to clear the aircraft trail \([Delete Aircraft Trail](MENUS.md#delete-aircraft-trail)\) before flight to avoid old trail segments in the exported GPX file. Or, disable the reloading of the trail in the options dialog on page **`Startup`**.**


##### Show Flight Plan in SkyVector {#export-flight-plan-as-skyvector}

Opens the default web browser and shows the current flight plan in [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com). Procedures are not shown.

Example: [ESMS NEXI2B NILEN L617 ULMUG M609 TUTBI Z101 GUBAV STM7C ENBO](https://skyvector.com/?fpl=ESMS%20NILEN%20L617%20ULMUG%20M609%20TUTBI%20Z101%20GUBAV%20ENBO). Note missing SID and STAR in SkyVector.

##### Save Waypoints for Approaches {#export-flight-plan-approach-waypoints}
##### Save Waypoints for SID and STAR {#export-flight-plan-sid-star-waypoints}

Save procedure waypoints instead of procedure information if checked. This affects all flight plan export and save formats.

Use this if your simulator, GPS or FMC does not support loading or display of approach procedures, SID or STAR.

Procedure information is replaced with respective waypoints that allow to display procedures in limited GPS or FMS units.

Saving flight plans with this method has several limitations:

* Several approach leg types like holds, turns and procedure turns cannot be displayed properly by using just waypoints/coordinates.
* Speed and altitude limitations are not included in the exported legs.
* The procedure information is dropped from the saved flight plan and cannot be reloaded properly in _Little Navmap_. Thus, you will see the waypoints of a SID or STAR but not the detailed procedure information. You have to delete the added waypoints and re-select the procedures after loading.

Due to these limitations it is recommended to save a copy of the flight plan with full information before enabling one of these options.

#### ![Add Google Earth KML](../images/icons/kmlfileopen.png "Add Google Earth KML") Add Google Earth KML {#add-google-earth-kml}

Allows addition of one or more Google Earth KML or KMZ files to the map display. All added KML or KMZ files will be reloaded on start up. Reload and centering can be switched off in the `Options` dialog on the `Startup` and `User Interface` tab.

Due to the variety of KML files it is not guaranteed that all files will show up properly on the map.

#### ![Clear Google Earth KML from Map](../images/icons/cancel.png "Clear Google Earth KML from Map") Clear Google Earth KML from Map {#clear-google-earth-kml-from-map}

Removes all loaded KML files from the map.

#### ![Offline](../images/icons/offline.png "Offline") Work Offline {#work-offline}

Stops loading of map data from the Internet. This affects the _OpenStreetMap_, _OpenTopoMap_ and all the other online map themes as well as the elevation data.
A red `Offline.` indication is shown in the status bar if this mode is enabled.

You should restart the application after going online again.

### ![Save Map as Image](../images/icons/mapsaveasimage.png "Save Map as Image") Save Map as Image {#save-map-as-image}

Saves the current map view as an image file. Allowed formats are JPEG, PNG and BMP.

### ![Print Map](../images/icons/printmap.png "Print Map") Print Map {#print-map}

Allows to print the current map view. See [Printing the Map](PRINT.md#printing-the-map) for more information.

### ![Print Flight Plan](../images/icons/printflightplan.png "Print Flight Plan") Print Flight Plan {#print-flight-plan}

Opens a print dialog that allows you to select flight plan related information to be printed. See [Map Flight Plan Printing](PRINT.md#printing-the-flight-plan) for more information.

### ![Quit](../images/icons/application-exit.png "Quit") Quit {#file-quit}

Exits the application. Will ask for confirmation if there is a changed flight plan.

### Flight Plan Menu {#flight-plan-menu}

#### ![Undo](../images/icons/undo.png "Undo")![Redo](../images/icons/redo.png "Redo") Undo/Redo {#undo-redo}

Allows undo and redo of all flight plan changes.

#### ![Select a Start Position for Departure](../images/icons/parkingstartset.png "Select a Start Position for Departure") Select a Start Position for Departure {#select-a-start-position-for-departure}

A parking spot \(gate, ramp or fuel box\), runway or helipad can be selected as a start position at the departure airport. A parking position can also be selected in the map context menu item [Set as Flight Plan Departure](MAPDISPLAY.md#set-as-flight-plan-departure) when right-clicking on a parking position. If no position is selected the longest primary runway end is selected automatically as start.

![Select Start Position Dialog](../images/selectstartposition.jpg "Select Start Position Dialog")

_**Picture above:** The start position selection dialog for EDDN._

#### ![Edit Flight Plan on Map](../images/icons/routeedit.png "Edit Flight Plan on Map") Edit Flight Plan on Map {#edit-flight-plan-on-map}

Toggles the flight plan drag and drop edit mode on the map. See [Flight Plan Editing](MAPFPEDIT.md#map-flight-plan-editing).

#### ![New Flight Plan from Route Description](../images/icons/newroutefromstring.png "New Flight Plan from Route Description") New Flight Plan from Route Description {#new-flight-plan-from-description}

Opens a dialog with the route description of the current flight plan that also allows to modify the current flight plan or enter a new one.
[Flight Plan from Route Description](ROUTEDESCR.md) gives more information about this topic.

#### ![Copy Flight Plan Route to Clipboard](../images/icons/routestring.png "Copy Flight Plan Route to Clipboard") Copy Flight Plan Route to Clipboard {#flight-plan-route-clipboard}

Copies the route description of the current flight plan to the clipboard using the settings from the [Flight Plan from Route Description](ROUTEDESCR.md#flight-plan-from-route-description) dialog.

#### ![Calculate Direct](../images/icons/routedirect.png "Calculate Direct") Calculate Direct {#calculate-direct}

Deletes all intermediate waypoints and connects departure and destination using a great circle line.

You can calculate a flight plan between any kind of waypoints, even user-defined waypoints \(right-click on the map and select `Add Position to Flight plan` to create one\). This allows the creation of snippets that can be merged into flight plans. For example you can use this feature for crossing the North Atlantic with varying departures and destinations. This applies to all flight plan calculation modes.

#### ![Calculate Radionav](../images/icons/routeradio.png "Calculate Radionav") Calculate Radionav {#calculate-radionav}

Creates a flight plan that uses only VOR and NDB stations as waypoints and tries to ensure reception of at least one station along the whole flight plan. Note that VOR stations are preferred before NDB and DME only stations are avoided if possible. Calculation will fail if not enough radio navaids can be found between departure and destination. Build the flight plan manually if this is the case.

This calculation can also be used to create a flight plan snippet between any kind of waypoint.

#### ![Calculate high Altitude](../images/icons/routehigh.png "Calculate high Altitude") Calculate high Altitude {#calculate-high-altitude}

Uses Jet airways to create a flight plan.

Calculated flight plans along airways will obey all airway restrictions like minimum and altitude. The program will also adhere to one-way and maximum altitude restrictions for X-Plane based navdata.

The resulting minimum altitude is set in the flight plan altitude field. The flight plan altitude field is not changed if no altitude restrictions were found along the flight plan.

A simplified east/west rule is used to adjust the cruise altitude to odd/even values \(this can be switched off in the `Options` dialog on the `Flight Plan` tab\).

The default behavior is to jump from the departure airport to the next waypoint of a suitable airway and vice versa for the destination. This can be changed in `Options` dialog on the `Flight Plan` tab if VOR or NDB stations are preferred as transition points to airways.

The airway network of Flight Simulator is not complete \(the north Atlantic tracks are missing for example - these change daily\), therefore calculation across large ocean areas can fail.

Create the airway manually as a workaround or use an online planning tool to obtain a route string and use the `New Flight Plan from String` option to create the flight plan.

This calculation can also be used to create a flight plan snippet between any kind of waypoint.

#### ![Calculate low Altitude](../images/icons/routelow.png "Calculate low Altitude") Calculate low Altitude {#calculate-low-altitude}

Uses Victor airways to create a flight plan. Everything else is the same as in `Calculate high Altitude`.

#### ![Calculate based on given Altitude](../images/icons/routealt.png "Calculate based on given Altitude") Calculate based on given Altitude {#calculate-based-on-given-altitude}

Use the value in the altitude field of the flight plan to find a flight plan along Victor and/or Jet airways. Calculation will fail if the altitude value is too low. Everything else is the same as in `Calculate high Altitude`.

#### ![Reverse Flight Plan](../images/icons/routereverse.png "Reverse Flight Plan") Reverse Flight Plan {#reverse-flight-plan}

Swaps departure and destination and reverses order of all intermediate waypoints. A default runway is assigned for the new departure start position.

Note that this function does not consider one-way airways in the X-Plane database and might result in an invalid flight plan.

#### ![Adjust Flight Plan Altitude](../images/icons/routeadjustalt.png "Adjust Flight Plan Altitude") Adjust Flight Plan Altitude {#adjust-flight-plan-alt}

Changes the flight plan altitude according to a simplified East/West rule and the current route type \(IFR or VFR\). Rounds the altitude up to the nearest even 1000 feet \(or meter\) for westerly flight plans or odd 1000 feet \(or meter\) for easterly flight plans. Adds 500 feet for VFR flight plans.

### Map Menu {#map-menu}

#### ![Goto Home](../images/icons/home.png "Goto Home") Goto Home {#goto-home}

Goes to the home area that was set using [Set Home](MAPDISPLAY.md#set-home) using the saved position and zoom distance. The center of the home area is highlighted by a ![Home Symbol](../images/icons/homesymbol.png "Home Symbol") symbol.

#### ![Go to Center for Distance Search](../images/icons/centermark.png "Go to Center for Distance Search") Go to Center for Distance Search {#go-to-center-for-distance-search}

Go to the center point used for distance searches. See [Set Center for Distance Search](MAPDISPLAY.md#set-center-for-distance-search).The center for the distance search is highlighted by a ![Distance Search Symbol](../images/icons/distancemark.png "Distance Search Symbol") symbol.

#### ![Center Flight Plan](../images/icons/centerroute.png "Center Flight Plan") Center Flight Plan {#center-flight-plan}

Zooms out the map \(if required\) to display the whole flight plan on the map.

#### ![Center Aircraft](../images/icons/centeraircraft.png "Center Aircraft") Center Aircraft {#center-aircraft}

Zooms to the user aircraft if directly connected to a flight simulator or remotely connected using [Little Navconnect](https://albar965.github.io/littlenavconnect.html) and keeps the aircraft centered on the map.

The centering of the aircraft can be changed in the `Options` dialog on the `Simulator Aircraft` tab.

#### ![Delete Aircraft Trail](../images/icons/aircrafttraildelete.png "Delete Aircraft Trail") Delete Aircraft Trail {#delete-aircraft-trail}

Removes the user aircraft trail. It is also deleted when connecting to a flight simulator. The trail is saved and will be reloaded on program startup.

#### ![Map Position Back](../images/icons/back.png "Map Position Back") ![Map Position Forward](../images/icons/next.png "Map Position Forward") Map Position Back/Forward {#map-position-back-forward}

Jumps forward or backward in the map position history. The complete history is saved and restored when starting _Little Navmap_.

### View Menu {#view-menu}

#### ![Reset Display Settings](../images/icons/centeraircraft.png "Reset Display Settings") Reset Display Settings {#reset-display-settings}

Resets all map display settings back to default.

![By Reset Affected Settings](../images/resetdisplaysettings.jpg "By Reset Affected Settings")

_**Picture above:** All setting tool buttons highlighted that are affected by _`Reset Display Settings`_._

#### Details

##### ![More Details](../images/icons/detailmore.png "More Details") More Details {#more-details}

##### ![Default Details](../images/icons/detaildefault.png "More Details") Default Details {#default-details}

##### ![Less Details](../images/icons/detailless.png "Less Details") Less Details {#less-details}

Increases or decreases the detail level for the map. More details means more airports, more navaids, more text information and bigger icons.

Note that map information will be truncated if too much detail is chosen. A red warning message will be shown in the statusbar if this is the case.

The detail level is shown in the statusbar. Range is -5 for least detail to +5 for most detail.

#### ![Force Show Addon Airports](../images/icons/airportaddon.png "Force Show Addon Airports") Force Show Addon Airports {#force-show-addon-airports}

Add-on airports are always shown independently of the other airport map settings if this option is selected. This allows viewing only add-on airports by checking this option and disabling the display of hard, soft and empty airports.

#### ![Show Airports with hard Runways](../images/icons/airport.png "Show Airports with hard Runways") Show Airports with hard Runways {#show-airports-with-hard-runways}

Show airports that have at least one runway with a hard surface.

#### ![Show Airports with soft Runways](../images/icons/airportsoft.png "Show Airports with soft Runways") Show Airports with soft Runways {#show-airports-with-soft-runways}

Show airports that have only soft surfaced runways or only water runways. This type of airport might be hidden on the map depending on zoom distance.

#### ![Show empty Airports](../images/icons/airportempty.png "Show empty Airports") Show empty Airports {#show-empty-airports}

Show empty airports. This button or menu item might not be visible depending on settings in the `Options` dialog on the `Map Display` tab. The status of this button is combined with the other airport buttons. This means, for example: You have to enable soft surfaced airport display and empty airports to see empty airports having only soft runways.

An empty airport is defined as one which has neither parking nor taxiways nor aprons and is not an add-on. These airports are treated differently in _Little Navmap_ since they are the most boring of all default airports. Empty airports are drawn gray and behind all other airports on the map.

Airports having only water runways are excluded from this definition to avoid unintentional hiding.

##### X-Plane and 3D airports

The function can be extended to X-Plane airports which are not marked as `3D`. This can be done by checking `Consider all X-Plane airports not being 3D empty` in the `Options` dialog on the `Map Display` tab. All airports not being marked as `3D` will be shown in gray on the map and can be hidden like described above if enabled.

An airport is considered 3D if it is stored in
`XPLANE/Custom Scenery/Global Airport Scenery/Earth nav data/apt.dat`.

The definition of `3D` is arbitrary, though. A `3D` airport may contain just a single object, such as a light pole or a traffic cone or it may be a fully constructed major airport.

#### ![Show VOR Stations](../images/icons/vor.png "Show VOR Stations") Show VOR Stations {#show-vor-stations}

#### ![Show NDB Stations](../images/icons/ndb.png "Show NDB Stations") Show NDB Stations {#show-ndb-stations}

#### ![Show Jet Airways](../images/icons/airwayjet.png "Show Jet Airways") Show Jet Airways {#show-jet-airways}

Show or hide these facilities or navaids on the map. Navaids might be hidden on the map depending on zoom distance.

#### Airspaces {#airspaces}

Note that airspaces are hidden if the airport diagram is shown.

##### ![Show Airspaces](../images/icons/airspace.png "Show Airspaces") Show Airspaces {#show-airspaces}

Allows to enable or disable the display of all airspaces with one click. Use the menu items below this one or the toolbar buttons to display or hide the various airspace types.

The airspaces toolbar contains buttons each having a drop down menu that allows to configure the airspace display like showing or hiding certain airspace types. Each drop down menu also has `All` and `None` entries to select or deselect all types in the menu.

##### ![Show Online Network Airspaces](../images/icons/airspaceonline.png "Show Online Network Airspaces") Show Online Network Airspaces {#show-online-airspaces}

This button or menu item is only visible if an online network is enabled.

It allows to hide or show center, tower, ground, approach and other airspaces from the currently selected online network independently of the simulator or Navigraph airspaces.

Online airspaces can also be shown or hidden by type using the menu items below.

Note that the displayed airspace circles do not depict the real airspace boundaries but are merely an indicator for the presence of an active center or tower.

See [Online Networks](ONLINENETWORKS.md) and [Online Flying](OPTIONS.md#online-flying).

##### ![ICAO Airspaces](../images/icons/airspaceicao.png "ICAO Airspaces") ICAO Airspaces {#icao-airspaces}

Allows selection of Class A to Class E airspaces.

##### ![FIR Airspaces](../images/icons/airspacefir.png "FIR Airspaces") FIR Airspaces {#fir-airspaces}

Allows selection of the Class F and Class G airspaces or flight information regions.

Show or hide MOA \(military operations area\), restricted, prohibited and danger airspaces.

##### ![Special Airspaces](../images/icons/airspacespec.png "Special Airspaces") Special Airspaces {#special-airspaces}

Show or hide warning, alert and training airspaces.

##### ![Other Airspaces](../images/icons/airspaceother.png "Other Airspaces") Other Airspaces {#other-airspaces}

Show or hide center, tower, mode C and other airspaces.

##### ![Airspace Altitude Limitations](../images/icons/airspacealt.png "Airspace Altitude Limitations") Airspace Altitude Limitations {#airspace-altitude-limitations}

Allows filtering of the airspace display by altitude. Either below or above 10,000 ft or 18,000 ft or only airspaces intersecting with the flight plan altitude.

#### Userpoints

Allows to hide or show user-defined waypoints by type.

The menu item `Unknown Types` shows or hides all types which do not belong to a known type.

The type `Unknown` ![Unknown](../images/icons/userpoint_Unknown.png "Airspace Altitude Limitations")
 shows or hides all userpoints which are exactly of type `Unknown`.

See [User-defined Waypoints](USERPOINT.md) for more information on user-defined waypoints.

#### ![Show Flight Plan](../images/icons/route.png "Show Flight Plan") Show Flight Plan {#show-flight-plan}

Show or hide the flight plan. The flight plan is shown independently of the zoom distance.

#### ![Show Missed Approaches](../images/icons/missed.png "Show Missed Approaches") Show Missed Approaches {#show-missed-approaches}

Show or hide the missed approaches of the current flight plan. This does not affect the preview in the search tab `Procedures`.

**Note that this function changes the active flight plan leg sequencing:** Sequencing the active leg will stop if the destination is reached and missed approaches are not displayed. Otherwise sequencing will continue with the missed approach and the simulator aircraft progress will show the remaining distance to the end of the missed approach instead.

#### ![Show Aircraft](../images/icons/aircraft.png "Show Aircraft") Show Aircraft {#show-aircraft}

Shows the user aircraft and keeps it centered on the map if connected to the simulator. The user aircraft is always shown independently of the zoom distance.

The icon color and shape indicates the aircraft type and whether the aircraft is on ground \(gray border\).

![User Aircraft](../images/icons/aircraft_small_user.png "User Aircraft") User aircraft in flight.

A click on the user aircraft shows more information in the `Simulator Aircraft` dock window.

More options to change the map behavior while flying can be found in the dialog `Options` on the tab [Simulator Aircraft](OPTIONS.md#simulator-aircraft).

The aircraft centering will be switched off when using one of the following functions. Note that this default behavior can be modified in the options dialog.

* Double-click into a table view or map display to zoom to an airport or a navaid.
* Context menu item `Show on map`.
* `Goto Home` or `Goto Center for Distance Search`.
* `Map` link in `Information` dock window.
* `Show Flight Plan`, when selected manually, or automatically after loading a flight plan.
* Centering a Google Earth KML/KMZ file after loading

This allows a quick inspection of an airport or navaid during flight. To display the aircraft again use `Map Position Back` or enable `Show Aircraft` again.

#### ![Show Aircraft Trail](../images/icons/aircrafttrail.png "Show Aircraft Trail") Show Aircraft Trail {#show-aircraft-trail}

Show the user aircraft trail. The trail is always shown independently of the zoom distance. It is saved and will be reloaded on program startup.

The trail is deleted when connecting to a flight simulator or it can be deleted manually by selecting `Main Menu` -&gt; `Map` -&gt; `Delete Aircraft Trail`. The trail is also deleted when the user aircraft jumps over large distance when assigning a new airport, for example.

The length of the trail is limited for performance reasons. If it exceeds the maximum length, the trail is truncated and the oldest segments are lost.

#### ![Show Compass Rose](../images/icons/compassrose.png "Show Compass Rose") Show Compass Rose {#show-compass-rose}

Show a compass rose on the map which indicates true north and magnetic north. Aircraft heading and aircraft track are shown if connected to a simulator.

The rose is centered around the user aircraft if connected. Otherwise it is centered on the map view.

See [Compass Rose](COMPASSROSE.md) for details.

#### ![Show AI and Multiplayer Aircraft](../images/icons/aircraftai.png "Show AI and Multiplayer Aircraft") ![Show AI and Multiplayer Ships](../images/icons/boatai.png "Show AI and Multiplayer Ships") Show AI and Multiplayer Aircraft or Ships {#show-map-ai-aircraft}

Shows AI and multiplayer aircraft or ships on the map. Multiplayer vehicles can be displayed from e.g. FSCloud, VATSIM or Steam sessions.

The icon color and shape indicates the aircraft type and whether the aircraft is on ground \(gray border\).

![AI or Multiplayer Aircraft](../images/icons/aircraft_small.png "AI or Multiplayer Aircraft") AI or multiplayer aircraft from the simulator. This includes aircraft that are injected by the various online network clients. A click on the AI aircraft or ship shows more information in the `Simulator Aircraft` dock window in the tab `AI / Multiplayer`.

![Online Multiplayer Aircraft](../images/icons/aircraft_online.png "User Aircraft") Multiplayer aircraft/client from an online network. See [Online Networks](ONLINENETWORKS.md). A click on the online  aircraft shows information in the `Information` dock window in the separate tab `Online Clients`.

Note that, in X-Plane, ship traffic is not available and AI aircraft information is limited.

The displayed vehicles are limited by the used multiplayer system if _Little Navmap_ is not connected to an online network like VATSIM or IVAO. Multiplayer aircraft will disappear depending on distance to user aircraft. For AI in FSX or P3D this is currently about 100 nautical miles or around 200 kilometers.

Smaller ships are only generated by the simulator within a small radius around the user aircraft.

_Little Navmap_ limits the display of AI vehicles depending on size. Zoom close to see small aircraft or boats.

On the lowest zoom distance all aircraft and ships are drawn to scale on the map.

Aircraft labels are forced to show independently of zoom level for the next five AI/multiplayer aircraft closest to the user that are within 20 nm distance and 5000 ft elevation.

All aircraft icons can be customized: [User, AI and Multiplayer Aircraft Icons](CUSTOMIZE.md#customize-aircraft-icons).

#### ![Show Map Grid](../images/icons/mapgrid.png "Show Map Grid") Show Map Grid {#show-map-grid}

Show a latitude/longitude grid as well as the [meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian) and [antimeridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian) \(near the date line\) on the map.

#### ![Show Country and City Names](../images/icons/cities.png "Show Country and City Names") Show Country and City Names {#show-country-and-city-names}

Show country, city and other points of interest. Availability of these options depends on the selected map theme. See [Theme](MENUS.md#theme).

#### ![Show Hillshading](../images/icons/hillshading.png "Show Hillshading") Show Hillshading {#show-hillshading}

Show hill shading on the map. Availability of these options depends on the selected map theme. See [Theme](MENUS.md#theme).

#### Projection {#projection}

##### Mercator {#mercator}

A flat projection that gives the most fluid movement and the sharpest map when using picture tile based online maps themes like _OpenStreetMap_ or _OpenTopoMap_.

##### Spherical {#spherical}

Shows earth as a globe which is the most natural projection. Movement can stutter slightly when using the picture tile based online maps themes like _OpenStreetMap_ or _OpenTopoMap_. Use the `Simple`, `Plain` or `Atlas` map themes to prevent this.

Online maps can appear slightly blurred when using this projection. This is a result from converting the flat image tiles to the spherical display.

![Little Navmap Spherical projection and Simple Map Theme](../images/sphericalpolitical.jpg "Little Navmap Spherical projection and Simple Map Theme")

_**Picture above:** Spherical map projection with _`Simple`_ offline map theme selected._

#### Theme {#theme}

Please note that all the online maps are delivered from free services therefore fast download speeds and high availability cannot be guaranteed. In any case it is easy to deliver and install a new online map source without creating a new _Little Navmap_ release. See [Creating or adding Map Themes](MAPTHEMES.md) for more information.

##### OpenStreetMap {#openstreetmap}

This is an online raster \(i.e. based on images\) map that includes a hill shading option. Note that the _OpenStreetMap_ hill shading does not cover the whole globe.

### Scenery Library Menu {#scenery-library-menu}

#### Flight Simulators {#flight-simulators}

One menu item is created for each Flight Simulator installation or database found. These menu items allow switching of databases on the fly. The menu item is disabled if only one Flight Simulator was found.

The loaded AIRAC cycle is displayed only for X-Plane since the information is not available for FSX or P3D simulators.

**You have to set the base path to the X-Plane directory in the **`Load Scenery Library Dialog`** first to enable the X-Plane menu item.**

This menu is synchronized with simulator selection in the [Load Scenery Library Dialog](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog). Once a database is successfully loaded, the display, flight plan and search will switch over to the newly loaded simulator data.

**Note that the program does not keep you from using a X-Plane scenery database while being connected to FSX/Prepar3D or vice versa. You will get unwanted effects like wrong weather information if using such a setup.**

The program might change a loaded flight plan if you switch between different databases. This can happen if a departure position is set in the plan which does not exist in the other database. Click `New Flight Plan` before switching to avoid this.

#### Navigraph {#navigraph}

This sub menu also indicating the AIRAC cycle is added if a Navigraph database is found in the database directory.

See the chapter [Navigation Databases](NAVDATA.md) for more information about these databases and the three different display modes shown below.

##### Use Navigraph for all Features {#navigraph-all}

Completely ignores the simulator database and takes all information from the Navigraph database.

##### Use Navigraph for Navaids and Procedures {#navigraph-navaid-proc}

This mode blends navaids and more from the Navigraph database with the simulator database. This affects the map display, all information and and all search windows.

##### Do not use Navigraph Database {#navigraph-none}

Ignores the Navigraph database and shows only information read from the simulator scenery.

#### Show Database Files {#show-database-files}

Open _Little Navmap_'s database directory in a file manager. See [Running without Flight Simulator Installation](RUNNOSIM.md#running-without-flight-simulator-installation) for more information on copying database files between different computers. This allows _Little Navmap_ to be run on a remote computer \(e.g. Windows, Mac or Linux\) using the same database that was created on the computer running the flight simulator.

#### ![Load Scenery Library](../images/icons/database.png "Load Scenery Library") Load Scenery Library {#load-scenery-library}

Open the `Load Scenery Library` dialog. See [Load Scenery Library Dialog](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog) for more information. This menu item is disabled if no flight simulator installations are found.

#### ![Copy Airspaces to X-Plane Database](../images/icons/airspacecopy.png "Copy Airspaces to X-Plane Database") Copy Airspaces to X-Plane Database {#copy-airspaces-to-xplane}

Copy airspace information from an FSX or P3D database to an X-Plane database. This is needed since X-Plane comes with limited airspace information.

All airspaces already loaded from X-Plane are deleted before copying. See [X-Plane Airspaces](SCENERY.md#load-scenery-library-dialog-xp-airspaces) for more information.

You have to switch to an FSX or P3D simulator database first to enable this menu item.

The airspace information is deleted when reloading the X-Plane database. Therefore you have to copy the airspaces again after reloading.

### Userdata Menu {#userdata-menu}

See [User-defined Waypoints](USERPOINT.md) for more information on user-defined waypoints.

#### Show Search {#userdata-menu-show-search}

Raise the dock window `Search` and the tab `Userpoints` where you can edit, add delete and seach user-defined waypoints.

#### Import CSV {#userdata-menu-import-csv}

Import a CSV file that is compatible with the widely used format from Plan-G and adds all the content to the database.

Note that the CSV format is the only format which allows to write and read all supported data fields.

See [CSV Data Format](USERPOINT.md#userpoints-csv) for a more detailed description.

#### Import X-Plane user_fix.dat {#userdata-menu-import-user-fix}

Import user-defined waypoints from the file `user_fix.dat`. The file does not exist by default in X-Plane and has to be created either manually or by exporting from _Little Navmap_.

The default location is `XPLANE/Custom Data/user_fix.dat`.

The imported userpoints are of type `Waypoint` ![Waypoint](../images/icons/userpoint_Waypoint.png "Waypoint") which can be changed after import using the bulk edit functionality.

The format is described by Laminar Research here: [XP-FIX1101-Spec.pdf](https://developer.x-plane.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XP-FIX1101-Spec.pdf).

See [X-Plane user_fix.dat Data Format](USERPOINT.md#userpoints-xplane) for more information.

#### Import Garmin GTN {#userdata-menu-import-garmin-gtn}

Reads user-defined waypoints from the Garmin `user.wpt` file. Refer to the manual of the Garmin unit you are using for more information about format and file location.

The imported userpoints are of type `Waypoint` ![Waypoint](../images/icons/userpoint_Waypoint.png "Waypoint") which can be changed after import using the bulk edit functionality.

See [Garmin user.wpt Data Format](USERPOINT.md#userpoints-garmin) for more information.

#### Export CSV {#userdata-menu-export-csv}

Create or append user-defined waypoints to a CSV file. A dialog asks if only selected userpoints should be exported and if the userpoints should be appended to an already present file.

Note that the exported file contains an extra column `Region` compared to the Plan-G format. The description field supports more than one line of text and special characters. Therefore, not all programs might be able to import this file. If needed, adapt the user-defined waypoints.

#### Export X-Plane user_fix.dat {#userdata-menu-export-user-fix}

Only selected userpoints or all can be exported. The exported data can optionally be appended to an already present file.

Not all data fields can be exported to this format. The ident field is required for export.

Also, you have to make sure that the user waypoint ident is unique within the `user_fix.dat`.

See [X-Plane user_fix.dat Data Format](USERPOINT.md#userpoints-xplane) for more information about limitations.

#### Export Garmin GTN {#userdata-menu-export-garmin-gtn}

Only selected userpoints or all can be exported. The exported data can optionally be appended to an already present file.

Not all data fields can be exported to this format. The ident field is required for export.
Some fields like the name are adapted to limitations.

See [X-Plane user_fix.dat Data Format](USERPOINT.md#userpoints-xplane) for more information about limitations.

#### Export XML for FSX/P3D BGL Compiler {#userdata-menu-export-bgl}

This export options creates an XML file which can be compiled into an BGL file containing waypoints.

The region and ident fields are required for this export option.

See the Prepar3D SDK documentation for information on how to compile the BGL and how to add this to the simulator.

#### Create Logbook entries {#userdata-menu-create-logbook}

Checking this menu item enables a simple logbook feature.

_Little Navmap_ will create a userpoint of type `Logbook` ![Logbook](../images/icons/userpoint_Logbook.png "Logbook") on each takeoff and landing when connected to a simulator.

These two logbook entries contain all available information, like the flight plan, time, fuel consumed and much more.

#### Clear database {#userdata-menu-clear-database}

Remove all user-defined waypoints from the database.

A CSV backup file named `little_navmap_userdata_backup.csv` is created in the settings directory `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ABarthel` before deleting all user-defined waypoints.

_Little Navmap_ also creates a full database backup on every start. See [Files](FILES.md#userdata).

### Tools Menu {#tools-menu}

#### ![Flight Simulator Connection](../images/icons/network.png "Flight Simulator Connection") Flight Simulator Connection {#flight-simulator-connection}

Open the `Connect` dialog allowing _Little Navmap_ to connect directly to a Flight Simulator, the *Little Xpconnect* X-Plane plugin, or remotely using the [Little Navconnect](https://albar965.github.io/littlenavconnect.html) agent. See [Connecting to a Flight Simulator](CONNECT.md#connecting-to-a-flight-simulator) for more information.

## Statusbar {#statusbar}

The statusbar at the bottom of the main window shows various indications \(from left to right\):

* Last action or quick help explaining a menu item or toolbar button.
* Connection status for a local or remote connection. The tooltip provides more detail about the status, like the hostname for remote connections.
  * `Connecting...`: The program is trying to establish a connection which was initiated either manually or automatically.
  * `Connected`: A connection was established.
  * `Disconnected`: The simulator or _Little Navconnect_ exited.
* Indicator that shows airport types, airspaces, navaids or AI vehicles currently visible on the map. The tooltip gives more details.
  * A red warning message `Too many objects` will be shown if too many objects are displayed on the map due to too high a detail level. The map display will be incomplete if this happens.
  * A red `Database empty` message will be shown if the currently selected database has no content and needs to be loaded.
* Map detail level. Range is -5 for least detail to +5 for most detail.
