## ![Traffic Pattern](../images/icons/trafficpattern.png "Traffic Pattern") Traffic Pattern {#traffic-pattern}

_Little Navmap_ can display an airport traffic patterns for guidance on the map.

Right click on an airport in the map, flight plan table or airport search result table and select [Display Airport Traffic Pattern](MAPDISPLAY.md#show-traffic-pattern).

This will show a dialog where you can select a runway and customize the pattern.

Note that the menu item is disabled if traffic patterns are hidden on the map (menu `View` -> `User Features`). The menu item is suffixed with the text `hidden on map` if this is the case.

_Little Navmap_ shows a tooltip with information about the traffic pattern when hovering the mouse above the hotspot (white filled circle) at runway threshold.

### Traffic Pattern Dialog

**Dialog input and selection fields:**

* Dialog header: Shows airport name and its ICAO ident as well as field elevation.
* `Runways`: List of available runways for the airport. Shows runway name, length, width, magnetic heading, surface and lighting status.
* `Turn direction`: Select to choose between left or right turn pattern. This is automatically updated when selecting a runway from FSX or P3D.
* `Base 45Â° after threshold`: Calculates the final leg length automatically when checked.
* `Base leg to runway threshold`: Length of the final leg. Measured from turn to final to the runway threshold.
* `Downwind to runway`: Parallel distance from downwind leg to runway.
* `Pattern altitude`: Pattern altitude above airport elevation. This is automatically updated when selecting a runway from FSX or P3D.
* `Entry and exit indicators`: Shows dashed lines and arrows giving hints for entry and exit points.
* `Line Color`: Color of the pattern lines and labels.

Traffic patterns can be removed by either selecting `Map` -> `Remove all Ranges, Measurements and Patterns` or by right click on the hotspot (circle) at the runway threshold.

A click on `OK` or a double click into the list `Runways` closes the dialog and creates the traffic pattern.

See [Legend - Airport Traffic  Pattern](LEGEND.md#airport-traffic-pattern) for details about the displayed numbers in the pattern.
